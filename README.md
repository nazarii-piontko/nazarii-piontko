# Hello, World! üåç I'm Nazarii Piontko

I'm a **Lead Software Engineer** with a penchant for fun and innovative projects. While I work professionally at **Future Processing**, my GitHub is a playground where I experiment, learn, and most importantly, have fun!

## üéÆ Fun Projects Overview

My repositories are a testament to my love for technology. From integrating OpenTelemetry with ASP.NET to diving deep into Named-entity recognition for the Ukrainian language, each project is a journey of exploration. I've also dabbled in game development with a nostalgic twist on the classic Snake game for Arduino. And for those who love a good chat, there's a GPT-powered Telegram chatbot designed to entertain. Each project, no matter how big or small, is a piece of my tech journey, and I invite you to explore them!

## üå± Always Learning

The tech world is vast, and there's always something new to discover. I'm on a continuous journey of learning, always looking for the next fun project or technology to dive into.
